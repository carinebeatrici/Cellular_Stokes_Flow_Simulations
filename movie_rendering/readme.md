# Image rendering and Movies creation

## Requirements

<ol>
  <li> Povray </li>
  <li> FFMPEG </li>
  <li> FORTRAN90 compiler </li>
</ol> 

To render movies in each simulation model, run the script run_render_images.sh in the folder where the simulations results are stored.
The result movie file is going to be called output.mp4, we sugest to rename it to a more signficant name.
